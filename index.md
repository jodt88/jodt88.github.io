# Games

## Independent Projects

*FlynnBALL*

This game was made as an assignment for the Video Game Design class given at LSU during the Spring 2017 semester. Our task was to create a pinball game using our then current knowledge of the game engine Unity 5.5.0f3. The grade for this assignment helped determine the 16 team leaders for the semester long group game project. This game ranked in the top 16 out of a class of about 80 students. This was my first game created using the Unity game engine, as well as my first game in general.

## Group Collaborations

*Innkeeper*

This game is being made as the semester-long project for the Video Game Design class given at LSU during the Spring 2017 semester. Our task is to use our basic knowledge of programming as well as the skills obtained from the class to create a short video game which will be presented to the class at the end of the semester. Our project team consists of four programmers and one artist, with me serving at the project leader. The game is currently unfinished, and is still in the prototyping phase.

# Art

## Photography

*Home*

Prior to the photography exam for St. Amant High School's Advanced Placement Studio Art class, I was experimenting with various locales around my home to find a theme. While this theme was not chosen in the end, I feel they provide a nice backdrop to demonstrate principles learned in the class.

*Rain*

This series is a continuation of the experimental process I took to find a theme for Studio Art's midterm exam.

*Orange*

This series consists of various satsumas from a tree in my backyard. While most of the satsuma's remained fresh on the tree, a few had fallen to the ground and began to rot. It was here that I found the theme for my Studio Art photography Midterm exam.

*Rot: St. Amant High School Advanced Placement Studio Art Exam*

This extensive series attempts to demonstrate the artistic principles obtained from my time as an art student. I purchased fruit from a local market, and left them out to rot over a course of several days. The rotting provided various gross, yet interesting textures. Fruits like the pinapple, and the inside of a pumpkin demonstrated repition.
