# Games

## Independent Projects

*FlynnBALL*

This game was made as an assignment for the Video Game Design class given at LSU during the Spring 2017 semester. Our task was to create a pinball game using our then current knowledge of the game engine Unity 5.5.0f3. The grade for this assignment helped determine the 16 team leaders for the semester long group game project. This game ranked in the top 16 out of a class of about 80 students. This was my first game created using the Unity game engine, as well as my first game in general.

## Group Collaborations

*Innkeeper*

This game is being made as the semester-long project for the Video Game Design class given at LSU during the Spring 2017 semester. Our task is to use our basic knowledge of programming as well as the skills obtained from the class to create a short video game which will be presented to the class at the end of the semester. Our project team consists of four programmers and one artist, with me serving at the project leader. The game is currently unfinished, and is still in the prototyping phase.
